  <h2 align="center">URGENT: Getting BANNED!</h2>

  <p align="center">
    <b>Using these hacks may result in a month-long or permanent ban from Blooket.<br></b>
    IF YOU GET BANNED, IT ISN'T OUR FAULT. Every script that might ban you has been removed.<br>
    <br>
    If you missed this and are currently banned, we can't actually do anything (there is no script).<br>
    Scripts can only interact with the site in certain ways, and unbanning isn't possible in this way.
